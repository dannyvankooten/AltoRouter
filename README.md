# AltoRouter 
AltoRouter is a small but powerful routing class for PHP 5.3+, heavily inspired by [klein.php](https://github.com/chriso/klein.php/).

* Dynamic routing with named parameters
* Reversed routing
* Flexible regular expression routing (inspired by [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/))

## Getting started

1. PHP 5.3.x is required
2. Setup URL rewriting so that all requests are handled by **index.php**
3. Create an instance of AltoRouter, map your routes and match a request.
4. Have a look at the supplied example file for a better understanding on how to use AltoRouter(index.php).

## Routing
```php
$router = new AltoRouter();
$router->setBasePath('/AltoRouter');

// mapping routes
$router->map('GET|POST','/', 'home#index', 'home');
$router->map('GET','/users/', array('c' => 'UserController', 'a' => 'ListAction'));
$router->map('GET','/users/[i:id]', 'users#show', 'users_show');
$router->map('POST','/users/[i:id]/[delete|update:action]', 'usersController#doAction', 'users_do');


// reversed routing
$router->generate('users_show', array('id' => 5));

```

You can use the following limits on your named parameters. AltoRouter will create the correct regexes.
```php
    *                    // Match all request URIs
    [i]                  // Match an integer
    [i:id]               // Match an integer as 'id'
    [a:action]           // Match alphanumeric characters as 'action'
    [h:key]              // Match hexadecimal characters as 'key'
    [:action]            // Match anything up to the next / or end of the URI as 'action'
    [create|edit:action] // Match either 'create' or 'edit' as 'action'
    [*]                  // Catch all (lazy, stops at the next trailing slash)
    [*:trailing]         // Catch all as 'trailing' (lazy)
    [**:trailing]        // Catch all (possessive - will match the rest of the URI)
    .[:format]?          // Match an optional parameter 'format' - a / or . before the block is also optional

Some more complicated examples

    /posts/[*:title][i:id]     // Matches "/posts/this-is-a-title-123"
    /output.[xml|json:format]? // Matches "/output", "output.xml", "output.json"
    /[:controller]?/[:action]? // Matches the typical /controller/action format

```
