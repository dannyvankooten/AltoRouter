# EdgeAltoRouter  ![PHP status](https://github.com/Acksop/EdgeAltoRouter/workflows/PHP/badge.svg)

EdgeAltoRouter is a small but powerful routing class, forked from [dannyvankooten.php](https://github.com/dannyvankooten/AltoRouter/) with an important addition : a config model file.

```php
$router = new EdgeAltoRouter(configModelUrl : __DIR__ . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'route.config');
$router->setBasePath(BASE_PATH);

$match = $router->match();

/*
 * $match may is like :
 * [
 *   'target' => 'home#index',
 *   'params' => [],
 *   'name' => 'home'
 * ]
 */

if( is_array($match) && is_callable( $match['target'] ) ) {
    call_user_func_array( $match['name'], $match['params'] ); 
} else {
    // no route was matched
    header( $_SERVER["SERVER_PROTOCOL"] . ' 404 Not Found');
}


// echo URL to home at index
echo $router->generate('home'); // Output: "home#index"
```

## Features

* Can be used with all HTTP Methods
* Dynamic routing with named route parameters
* Reversed routing
* Flexible regular expression routing (inspired by [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/))
* Custom regexes
* Support a config file who is like Yaml
* Configure your style of use : Memory or Speed

## Getting started

You need PHP >= 8.0 to use EdgeAltoRouter, although we highly recommend you [use an officially supported PHP version](https://secure.php.net/supported-versions.php) that is not EOL.
